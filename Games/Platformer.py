# # 2Ô∏è‚É£ The player falls due to gravity and lands on platforms.

#
class platform:
   #  def Platform(self):
      #  pygame.draw.rect(x, y, 20, 10)

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ The player can jump when on a platform.

# for platform in platform:
   # if self.rect.top = self.rect.bottom:
        

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ The game stops the player from falling off the screen.





# Steps to Follow:
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Game Window:
# Set up Pygame and create a 600x400 window.
# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Make the Player:

# Use a rectangle to represent the player.
# The player should be able to move left and right.
# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add Gravity & Jumping:
Gravity = 0.5
Height = 5
Speed = 5


# The player should fall down naturally (simulate gravity).
# The player should be able to jump when on a platform.
# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Add Platforms:




# Create a few platforms for the player to land on.
# The player should stop falling when standing on a platform.
# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Prevent Falling Off the Screen:

pygame.quit()
# If the player falls below the screen, reset their position.
# Hints & Ideas:
# üí° Hint 1: Use pygame.Rect(x, y, width, height) to create rectangles for the player and platforms.
# üí° Hint 2: To move the player, check pygame.key.get_pressed().
# üí° Hint 3: To apply gravity, increase the player‚Äôs vertical speed (player_velocity_y).
# üí° Hint 4: To stop the player when landing, check for collisions with platforms.


# üïπÔ∏è Step 1: Set Up Pygame
# What to Do?
# Import pygame and initialize it.
# Create a screen with a width and height.
# Set a game title.
# Make a game loop so the window stays open.

# Hints
# Use pygame.init() to start Pygame.
# To create a window, use pygame.display.set_mode((WIDTH, HEIGHT)).
# The game loop runs until the player quits. It should use while running:.
# Quit when the player closes the window (pygame.QUIT).

# üïπÔ∏è Step 2: Draw the Player
# What to Do?
# Create a player using a rectangle (pygame.Rect()).
# Draw the player inside the game loop.
# Make the player move left and right when arrow keys are pressed.
# Hints
# A rectangle can be drawn with pygame.draw.rect().
# To move left, decrease player.x. To move right, increase it.
# Use pygame.key.get_pressed() to check if a key is being held down.

# üïπÔ∏è Step 3: Add Gravity and Jumping
# What to Do?
# Add a velocity (speed) for the player‚Äôs movement.
# Make the player fall down (gravity).
# Make the player jump when pressing SPACE.
# Hints
# Use a variable like player_velocity_y to control the falling speed.
# To apply gravity, increase player_velocity_y every frame.
# When jumping, set player_velocity_y to a negative number.
# Jumping should only happen when the player is on a platform (not mid-air).

# üïπÔ∏è Step 4: Add Platforms
# What to Do?
# Create a list of platforms using pygame.Rect().
# Draw all platforms inside the game loop.
# Make sure the player lands on platforms instead of falling through.
# Hints
# Store platforms in a list: platforms = [pygame.Rect(x, y, width, height), ...].
# Use a for loop to draw all platforms.
# When the player touches a platform from above, stop them from falling (player.bottom = platform.top).

# üïπÔ∏è Step 5: Prevent Falling Off the Screen
# What to Do?
# Make sure the player stays within the screen.
# If the player falls below the screen, reset them.
# Hints
# Check if player.bottom is greater than HEIGHT (screen bottom).
# If the player falls off, reset their position to the top.
