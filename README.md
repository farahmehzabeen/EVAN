🌟 GitHub Guide
This is my personal guide to using GitHub to help me remember how to put my projects online and share them with others.

🛠️ 1. Making a New Repository

- Click the + in the top-right of GitHub.
- Choose New repository.
- Give it a name (like clicker-thingy).
- Add a short description.
- Check Add a README file.
- Click Create repository.

📂 2. Uploading Files

- Open your repository.
- Click Add file → Upload files.
- Drag and drop your code files (like game.py).
- Scroll down and click Commit changes.

✏️ 3. Editing Files Online

- Open the file you want to edit.
- Click the pencil icon.
- Make changes.
- Write a short commit message (like “fixed typo”).
- Click Commit changes.

💾 4. Saving Progress (Commits)

- A commit = a “save point” for your project.
- Always write a short message about what you changed.
- Example: “Added counter to the game”.
- Commits build a history of your project.

☁️ 5. GitHub Desktop (Easier Way)

- Download GitHub Desktop.
- Sign in with your GitHub account.
- Click Clone repository to copy your project to your computer.
- When you make changes:
- Write a commit message.
- Click Commit to main.
- Click Push origin to send it to GitHub.

🖼️ 6. Adding Cool Stuff

- Add a README.md file to explain your project.
- Add screenshots or even GIFs of your game.
- Use Markdown (headings, bold, lists, code blocks).
